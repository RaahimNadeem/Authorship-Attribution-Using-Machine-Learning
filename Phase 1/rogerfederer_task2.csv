now more than ever we must come together to help families in need  
     
it probably should have happened a long time ago but maybe now is really the time these are tough times in every sport and we can come out of this weakened bodies stronger body 
i agree with you its too confusing for the fans when there are different ranking systems different logos different websites different tournament categories 
i am not talking about merging competition on the court but merging governing bodies atp and wta that oversee the mens and womens professional tours
i am picturing a merger between the wta and atp  
just wonderingam i the only one thinking that now is the time for mens and womens tennis to be united and come together as one
